Stadt Falkensee News RSS
========================
This is a simple wrapper written in PHP which converts the news section of the Stadt Falkensee Website (https://www.falkensee.de) into an RSS 2.0 feed.

Version 1.1

Install
-------

In order to use this wrapper you just need php and php-xml installed.

Simply execute the wrapper on the comandline:
```bash
php index.php
```

Alternatively you can point your webserver to the cloned repository and it should automatically call index.php and render the feed.
